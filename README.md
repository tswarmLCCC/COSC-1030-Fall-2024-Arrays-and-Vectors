This week, we will be using a modified assignment style.  You'll find Overview, Predict and Run, Investigate, and Modify activities.  These are optional!  The only graded assignment is the "Make Assignment".  The others provide some tasks that will give examples to play with in different ways.  There should be an "Instructions" tab in each project to guide you.  In case it does not show up, I've copied the Make Instructions here.
