One of the most powerful uses of computer programming is the ability to repeat instructions over changing, but similar, data.  Looping gives us that very capability in the way to construct repeating instructions.  Collections give us the other part of that equation.  We can house data in structures such as arrays and vectors and exploit that structure to perform quick operations on familiar data patterns.  

This unit follows and expands on our work in the previous unit on looping to that end.
